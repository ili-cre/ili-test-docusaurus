title: Installing an External Power Supply & Fail Safe Electric Lock
---

**You will need:**

* Kisi Controller Pro (comes with a 24V Universal AC power supply)- **Included** in the Kisi Controller Pack
* 12 or 24V DC [fail safe electric strike or magnetic lock] (https://www.getkisi.com/guides/electronic-locks) - **NOT** Included
* Ethernet Cable - **NOT** Included
* Low Voltage Wires - **NOT** Included
* [External Power Supply] (https://www.altronix.com/products/AL600ULACM) for lock - **NOT** Included
* Push to exit button/motion sensor - **NOT** Included
* Keypad - **NOT** Included

*NOTE*

The wiring should also run to a keypad outside the space and a REX (Request to Exit) inside the space. A keypad should be used as a back-up mode of access in case internet goes down. A REX allows an occupant to exit the door without using Kisi, and would refer to either a motion sensor or a push-to-exit button.
